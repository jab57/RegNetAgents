## Perturbation Analysis 🎯

### **Candidate Regulator Prioritization**
Ranks upstream regulators as candidates for experimental validation using standard network centrality metrics from computational biology literature.

### **How It Works**
1. **Regulatory Baseline**: Analyzes the gene's upstream regulators
2. **Network Graph Construction**: Builds NetworkX directed graph from regulatory network
3. **Centrality Calculation**: Computes 5 standard metrics for each regulator (once per cell type, then cached)
4. **Ranking**: Ranks regulators by PageRank (best predictor of drug targets per Mora & Donaldson 2021)
5. **Alternative Rankings**: Also provides rankings by out-degree centrality for comparison

### **Standard Network Centrality Metrics**

Uses established metrics from computational biology literature (NetworkX implementation):

**Degree Centrality:**
```
C_D(R) = deg(R) / (N - 1)
```
Total connections normalized by network size. Identifies hub regulators.

**Out-Degree Centrality:**
```
C_out(R) = deg_out(R) / (N - 1)
```
Downstream targets normalized by network size. Hub regulator importance.

**Betweenness Centrality:**
```
C_B(R) = Σ σ_st(R) / σ_st
```
Fraction of shortest paths passing through node. Identifies bottlenecks. *(Skipped for networks >1000 nodes due to O(N³) complexity)*

**Closeness Centrality:**
```
C_C(R) = (N - 1) / Σ d(R, v)
```
Inverse average distance to all nodes. Global influence. *(Skipped for networks >1000 nodes)*

**PageRank (Primary Ranking):**
```
PR(R) = (1-d)/N + d × Σ PR(v)/L(v)
```
Google's algorithm adapted for biology. Measures connection quality. **Best predictor of successful drug targets** (Mora & Donaldson 2021). Normalized by max value for large networks.

**Regulatory Loss:**
```
Loss(%) = (1 / total_regulators) × 100
```
Percentage of target gene's regulatory input lost when regulator is inhibited.

### **Ranking Strategy**
- **Primary**: PageRank (proven best predictor of drug targets in literature)
- **Secondary**: Out-degree centrality (hub identification and off-target assessment)

**Evidence from Literature:**
- Approved drug targets show significantly higher PageRank and degree centrality (Mora & Donaldson 2021)
- PageRank >0.30 indicates high-quality network connections typical of drug targets
- All regulators of a gene contribute equally to direct regulatory input (1/num_regulators)

### **Output Provided**
For each regulator tested:
- **Network Centrality Metrics**: PageRank, degree centrality, out-degree centrality
- **Downstream Targets**: Number of genes directly regulated by this regulator (off-target estimate)
- **Cascade Overlap**: Genes regulated by both the regulator and target gene
- **Rankings**: Multiple rankings (PageRank primary, out-degree centrality secondary)

**Important**: Metrics are network topology-based and do not predict actual gene expression changes. Use for prioritizing regulators for experimental validation.

### **Example Results (TP53)**
```json
{
  "top_target_by_pagerank": {
    "regulator": "WWTR1",
    "pagerank": 0.4734,
    "degree_centrality": 0.0213,
    "regulatory_loss_pct": 14.3,
    "downstream_targets": 293
  },
  "top_target_by_degree": {
    "regulator": "RBPMS",
    "degree_centrality": 0.0289,
    "downstream_targets": 403
  },
  "rankings": {
    "by_pagerank": ["WWTR1", "RBPMS", "PRRX2", "CHD4", "THRA"],
    "by_degree": ["RBPMS", "WWTR1", "CHD4", "YAP1", "IKZF2"]
  },
  "interpretation": "WWTR1 shows strong therapeutic potential. High PageRank (0.473) indicates high-quality connections typical of successful drug targets. As a hub regulator (293 targets), inhibiting this gene would have broad network effects."
}
```

**Interpretation**: WWTR1 ranked #1 by PageRank, indicating superior connection quality in the network. The 14.3% regulatory loss is equal across all 7 regulators (1/7), so centrality metrics differentiate therapeutic potential. Experimental validation confirmed WWTR1/YAP1 (Hippo pathway) as validated TP53 regulators.

### **Automatic Activation**
Perturbation analysis runs automatically when:
- Gene has **>5 upstream regulators**
- Using `comprehensive_gene_analysis` tool
- Regulator analysis completes successfully

### **Performance**
- **First calculation**: 300-500ms (builds NetworkX graph + calculates centrality metrics for cell type)
- **Subsequent queries**: <10ms (uses cached centrality metrics)
- **Optimization**: Focus on PageRank, degree, and out-degree centrality (computationally efficient metrics)
- **Regulators Analyzed**: Up to 10 simultaneously
- **Integration**: Seamlessly included in comprehensive workflow

### **Key Features**
- **Focused Metrics**: Uses three core centrality measures (PageRank, degree, out-degree)
- **Evidence-Based**: PageRank ranking validated by Mora & Donaldson (2021) drug target study
- **Automated**: Runs automatically for genes with >5 regulators
- **Multiple Rankings**: Provides rankings by PageRank (primary) and out-degree centrality (secondary)
- **Cascade Analysis**: Shows downstream effects of inhibiting each regulator
- **Literature-Validated**: Successfully predicts experimentally confirmed regulators (e.g., WWTR1, YAP1 for TP53)

### **Intelligent Sequential Routing (Optimized)**
The workflow makes smart priority-based decisions for efficient sequential execution:

```python
def _route_next_action(state):
    gene_info = state["gene_info"]
    num_regulators = gene_info["num_regulators"]
    num_targets = gene_info["num_targets"]
    regulatory_role = gene_info["regulatory_role"]
    is_regulator = gene_info["is_regulator"]
    completed_steps = state["analysis_metadata"]["steps_completed"]

    # HIGH PRIORITY: Analyze regulators for heavily regulated genes
    if num_regulators > 15 and 'regulators_analysis' not in completed_steps:
        return "regulators"  # High priority path

    # HIGH PRIORITY: Analyze targets for hub regulators
    if is_regulator and num_targets > 20 and 'targets_analysis' not in completed_steps:
        return "targets"  # High priority path

    # MEDIUM PRIORITY: Analyze regulators for moderately regulated genes
    if num_regulators > 5 and 'regulators_analysis' not in completed_steps:
        return "regulators"

    # MEDIUM PRIORITY: Analyze targets for intermediate regulators
    if is_regulator and num_targets > 5 and 'targets_analysis' not in completed_steps:
        return "targets"

    # Perturbation analysis (candidate regulator prioritization)
    if 'regulators_analysis' in completed_steps \
       and 'perturbation_analysis' not in completed_steps \
       and num_regulators > 5:
        return "perturbations"  # Simulate regulator inhibition for drug targeting

    # Pathway analysis using Reactome (requires core data)
    if ('regulators_analysis' in completed_steps or 'targets_analysis' in completed_steps) \
       and 'pathway_analysis' not in completed_steps:
        return "pathways"  # Reactome enrichment with p-values and FDR

    # Cross-cell comparison for important genes
    if (regulatory_role in ['hub_regulator', 'master_regulator'] or num_regulators > 15) \
       and 'cross_cell_analysis' not in completed_steps:
        return "cross_cell"

    # Domain analyses (comprehensive mode only) - FAST execution
    if state['analysis_depth'] == 'comprehensive':
        has_core_data = ('regulators_analysis' in completed_steps or
                        'targets_analysis' in completed_steps)

        if has_core_data and 'cancer_domain_analysis' not in completed_steps:
            return "cancer_domain"
        if has_core_data and 'drug_domain_analysis' not in completed_steps:
            return "drug_domain"

        if has_core_data and 'systems_domain_analysis' not in completed_steps:
            return "systems_domain"

    return "complete"
```

**Performance Note**: Similarity analysis has been removed (previously took 30-60 seconds). Domain analyses are enabled in comprehensive mode and execute in <1ms total, providing valuable research insights with no performance impact.

## Data Processing Pipeline

### **Network Cache Generation**
The RegNetAgents system uses pre-computed network indices for optimal performance. The `build_network_cache.py` script converts raw regulatory network data into optimized cache files.

#### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Process all cell types from TSV files
python build_network_cache.py --all

# Process specific cell type
python build_network_cache.py epithelial_cell
```

#### **Data Sources**
The 10 cell type networks are derived from CellxGene Portal single-cell RNA-seq data processed through the ARACNe algorithm:

**Pipeline Overview:**
```
CellxGene Data → Quality Control → Metacells → ARACNe Networks → TSV Files → Optimized Caches
```

**10 Available Cell Types:**
- 9 immune/blood cell types (CD4/CD8 T cells, CD14/CD16 monocytes, CD20 B cells, NK/NKT cells, erythrocytes, dendritic cells)
