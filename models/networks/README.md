# Network files

## GREmLN cell-type networks (bundled)

The 10 cell-type directories here (`cd14_monocytes/` … `nkt_cells/`, `epithelial_cell/`) hold
pre-computed ARACNe networks from the GREmLN project:

- **Source:** GREmLN Quickstart tutorial data
  (https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com/quickstart/gremln-quickstart), Chan Zuckerberg
  Initiative Virtual Cells Platform. `network.tsv` is the file as downloaded;
  `network_index.pkl` is a lookup cache built from it by `scripts/build_network_cache.py`.
- **Terms:** obtained under the
  [Virtual Cells Platform Terms of Use](https://virtualcellmodels.cziscience.com/terms-of-use)
  (scientific research use). The GREmLN model is MIT-licensed; no separate license is stated
  for the tutorial networks, and they are **not** covered by the MIT license of the
  RegNetAgents source code. They are included for convenience and research use; they will be
  removed on request of the rights holder.
