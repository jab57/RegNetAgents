## ✅ Step 6: Set Up Repository Settings
**Status:** RECOMMENDED (Optional enhancements below)

### 6.1 Add Repository Topics (Optional)

On GitHub repository page:
1. Click **"About"** (gear icon)
2. Add topics: `gene-regulatory-networks`, `mcp-server`, `claude-code`, `bioinformatics`, `multi-agent-systems`, `langgraph`
3. Save changes

### 6.2 Configure Default Branch

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Ensure default branch is `main`
3. (Optional) Add branch protection rules later

---

## ✅ Step 7: Test Clone
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

Repository was successfully cloned and tested:
- ✅ Clone successful (114.54 MB downloaded)
- ✅ LFS files downloaded correctly
- ✅ Virtual environment created
- ✅ Dependencies installed (60+ packages)
- ✅ MCP server runs without errors
- ✅ Ollama integration working

**Installation verified and ready for users!**

---

## Step 8: Create Release (Optional, Future)

When ready to share more widely:

1. Go to repository → **Releases** → **Create a new release**
2. Tag: `v0.1.0`
3. Title: `Initial Release - RegNetAgents v0.1.0`
4. Description: Brief overview
5. Mark as "pre-release" if still testing
6. Publish

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: LFS push fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check LFS bandwidth quota
git lfs env

# If quota exceeded, wait or upgrade GitHub plan
```

### Issue: Push rejected (non-fast-forward)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Pull first (if you made changes on GitHub)
git pull --rebase origin main
git push -u origin main
```

### Issue: .env file accidentally committed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Remove from git but keep local file
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove .env from repository"
git push

# Then update .gitignore to include .env
```
