**LLM-Powered Multi-Agent Framework for Gene Regulatory Analysis**

RegNetAgents is an AI-powered multi-agent framework that provides comprehensive gene regulatory network analysis through Claude Desktop. Built on **pre-computed gene regulatory networks** derived from single-cell RNA-seq data, and powered by LangGraph workflow orchestration, it deploys four specialized LLM-powered domain agents (cancer biology, drug discovery, clinical relevance, and systems biology) that generate scientific insights using local Ollama inference.

**Analyze 10 different cell types** including immune cells, blood cells, and epithelial tissue to understand gene regulation, discover biomarkers, and explore disease mechanisms—with AI-generated rationales and interpretations.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Note:** RegNetAgents is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/jab57/RegNetAgents under the MIT License.

**Time required:** 5-10 minutes

### Step 1: Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Claude Desktop installed
- Internet connection (for Reactome pathway analysis)

### Step 2: Environment Setup

Clone the repository and set up your environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jab57/RegNetAgents.git
cd RegNetAgents

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac:
source env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Install Ollama (LLM Engine)

**RegNetAgents uses local LLM-powered agents by default.** Install Ollama for AI-generated insights:

```bash
# 1. Download and install Ollama
# Visit: https://ollama.com/download
# (5 minute install, runs as background service)

# 2. Pull the recommended model
ollama pull llama3.1:8b

# 3. Verify installation
ollama list
# Should show: llama3.1:8b

# 4. Configure RegNetAgents
cp .env.example .env
# Default USE_LLM_AGENTS=true (already set)
```

**What this enables:**
- Scientific rationales for cancer biology insights
- Detailed therapeutic target assessments
- Clinical actionability explanations
- Systems biology interpretations

**Performance:** 15.49 seconds (rule-based) or ~62 seconds (LLM-powered) for 5-gene analysis (1,900-3,700× faster than manual workflows)

**Fallback:** If Ollama unavailable, system uses fast rule-based heuristics automatically.

### Step 4: Verify Network Data

Check that network cache files exist:

```bash
# Verify 10 cell types are ready
python -c "
import os
cell_types = ['epithelial_cell', 'cd14_monocytes', 'cd16_monocytes',
              'cd20_b_cells', 'cd4_t_cells', 'cd8_t_cells', 'erythrocytes',
              'nk_cells', 'nkt_cells', 'monocyte-derived_dendritic_cells']

ready = sum(1 for ct in cell_types if os.path.exists(f'models/networks/{ct}/network_index.pkl'))
print(f'Ready: {ready}/10 cell types')
"
```

**Expected output:** `Ready: 10/10 cell types`

If network cache files are missing, contact the repository maintainer.

### Step 5: Configure Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the RegNetAgents MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "regnetagents": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\RegNetAgents\\regnetagents_langgraph_mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `C:\\path\\to\\RegNetAgents` with your actual path. Use double backslashes on Windows.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely (quit and reopen)

### Step 6: Verify Installation

Run the verification script to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
python verify_installation.py
```

This will check:
- Python version (3.8+)
- Required packages
- Network data files
- Ollama installation (optional)
- Core modules

**Expected output:** `5/5 checks passed`

### Step 7: Test with Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and ask:

```
Analyze the TP53 gene in epithelial cells
```

**Expected result:** You should get a comprehensive analysis including:
- Gene regulatory network information
- Upstream regulators
- Downstream targets
- Pathway enrichment analysis
- **AI-generated domain insights** (cancer, drug, clinical, systems biology)

If Ollama is running, you should see detailed scientific rationales. Check the analysis includes `"llm_powered": true` in domain results.

**Success!** You're ready to use RegNetAgents!

### Step 8: Test LLM Integration (Optional)

Run the test suite to verify all 4 domain agents are using LLM:

```bash
python tests/test_ollama_agents.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Ollama is running
✓ All 4 domain agents used LLM
✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

### Step 9: Try More Examples

```
What regulates BRCA1 in epithelial cells?

Compare MYC, TP53, and KRAS across different cell types

Find biomarkers for colon cancer screening

What pathways is IL6 involved in for immune cells?
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Network index file missing" error

**Problem:** MCP server fails to load a cell type.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check which cell types have cache files
ls models/networks/*/network_index.pkl

# If missing, generate cache:
python scripts/build_network_cache.py --all
```

### Claude Desktop doesn't show RegNetAgents tools

**Problem:** Tools don't appear in Claude Desktop.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the config path is correct in `claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Use **absolute path**, not relative (e.g., `C:\\Users\\...` not `./`)
3. Use double backslashes on Windows (`\\` not `\`)
4. Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit and reopen)
5. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

### "Module not found" errors

**Problem:** Python import errors when starting server.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
# Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac:
source env/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Analysis returns empty results

**Problem:** Gene analysis completes but shows no regulators/targets.

**Possible causes:**
1. Gene not in network for that cell type (normal - try different cell type)
2. Gene symbol not recognized (try Ensembl ID like ENSG00000141510)
3. Network cache corrupted (regenerate with `build_network_cache.py`)

### Reactome pathway analysis fails

**Problem:** Pathway enrichment section shows errors.

**Solution:** Requires internet connection. Check network connectivity or firewall settings.

## Example Use Cases (No Biology Degree Required)

### Cancer Research
**Question**: "What regulates the APC gene in colon cells?"
- **Why it matters**: APC mutations cause colorectal cancer - it's one of the most commonly mutated genes in colon tumors
- **What you'll learn**: Which genes control APC, what pathways it participates in, and potential therapeutic targets
- **Try it**: `comprehensive_gene_analysis` with gene="APC", cell_type="epithelial_cell"

### Drug Discovery
**Question**: "What genes does BRCA1 regulate in breast tissue?"
- **Why it matters**: BRCA1 mutations dramatically increase breast cancer risk (60-80% lifetime risk)
- **What you'll learn**: Downstream targets for potential drug interventions, pathway disruptions, druggable proteins
- **Try it**: `comprehensive_gene_analysis` with gene="BRCA1", cell_type="epithelial_cell"

### Therapeutic Target Prioritization
**Question**: "What happens if I inhibit TP53 upstream regulators?"
- **Why it matters**: Identifies which regulators have the biggest impact when targeted by drugs or therapies
- **What you'll learn**: Top therapeutic targets ranked by network centrality metrics (PageRank, out-degree centrality), cascade effects, druggability assessment
- **Network metrics**: Uses established centrality measures from computational biology literature (PageRank, degree centrality, out-degree centrality)
- **Evidence-based ranking**: PageRank is the best predictor of successful drug targets according to Mora & Donaldson (2021)
- **Try it**: `comprehensive_gene_analysis` with gene="TP53" - therapeutic target prioritization runs automatically for genes with >5 regulators
- **Example output**: "WWTR1 (PageRank 0.47) would reduce TP53 regulation by 14.3% and affect 293 downstream genes"

**Important Limitation**: Perturbation analysis is topology-based and ranks regulators for experimental investigation. It does **NOT** predict gene expression changes or model dynamic regulatory responses. Results prioritize candidates for validation, not expression predictions.

### Understanding Disease Mechanisms
**Question**: "How does TP53 behave differently across cell types?"
- **Why it matters**: TP53 is mutated in over 50% of all cancers - it's the most important tumor suppressor
- **What you'll learn**: Cell-specific regulatory networks, why some tissues are more cancer-prone than others
- **Try it**: `multi_gene_analysis` or use cross-cell comparison features

### Immune System Research
**Question**: "What pathways are enriched for IL6 in immune cells?"
- **Why it matters**: IL6 is a key inflammatory signal involved in autoimmune diseases and COVID-19 severity
- **What you'll learn**: Biological pathways, potential drug targets for reducing inflammation
- **Try it**: `pathway_focused_analysis` with gene="IL6", cell_type="cd14_monocytes"

**Popular genes to explore**:
- Cancer: TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, APC, KRAS, MYC, PTEN, RB1
- Immune system: IL6, TNF, IFNG, IL10, CD4, CD8A
- Blood cells: HBB (erythrocytes), CD4 (T cells), CD8A (T cells)
- Inflammation: IL6, TNF, IFNG (monocytes)

## Terminology Guide

**Core Concepts**:
- **Gene**: A section of DNA that contains instructions for making a protein (e.g., "TP53", "BRCA1")
- **Regulator**: A gene that controls whether another gene is turned "on" or "off"
- **Target**: A gene that is being controlled by a regulator
- **Gene Symbol**: Short name for a gene (e.g., "APC") - what humans use
- **Ensembl ID**: Database identifier (e.g., "ENSG00000134982") - what computers use

**Network Terms**:
- **Regulatory Network**: Map showing which genes control other genes in a specific cell type
- **Hub Regulator**: A gene that controls many other genes (>20 targets - like a master switch)
- **Heavily Regulated**: A gene that is controlled by many regulators (>15 regulators - complex control)
- **Weakly Regulated**: A gene with few regulators and no downstream targets (simple endpoint)

**Analysis Terms**:
- **Pathway**: A group of genes working together for a biological process (e.g., "Wnt signaling", "Cell cycle")
- **Enrichment**: Statistical test showing if certain pathways are over-represented
- **p-value**: Probability the result happened by chance (lower = more confident)
- **FDR (False Discovery Rate)**: Corrected p-value accounting for multiple tests (< 0.05 = statistically significant)
- **Therapeutic Target Prioritization**: Network-based ranking of regulators by centrality metrics (topology-based target prioritization, not dynamic expression simulation)

**Network Centrality Metrics** (for ranking therapeutic targets):
- **PageRank**: Google's algorithm adapted for biology - measures connection quality (best predictor of drug targets)
- **Degree Centrality**: How many connections a gene has (total incoming + outgoing) - measures overall connectivity
- **Out-Degree Centrality**: How many downstream targets a gene regulates - identifies hub regulators and cascade breadth
- **Regulatory Loss**: Percentage of target gene's regulation lost when a regulator is inhibited (for interpretation, not ranking)

**Cell Types** (10 available):
- **Epithelial cells**: Barrier tissues (skin, lung, intestine) - where most cancers start
- **CD14/CD16 Monocytes**: Immune cells that fight infections
- **CD4/CD8 T cells**: Adaptive immune cells that attack pathogens and cancer
- **B cells (CD20)**: Produce antibodies for immune defense
- **NK/NKT cells**: Natural killer cells that attack infected/cancer cells
- **Erythrocytes**: Red blood cells that carry oxygen
- **Dendritic cells**: Activate immune responses

**Don't worry if you don't know all these terms** - the MCP server provides explanations in its outputs!
