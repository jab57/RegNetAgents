### Step 1: Create PDF (~2 minutes)

You already have `regnetagents_preprint.docx` ready to convert.

**Method: Convert Word to PDF**

1. Open `C:\Dev\RegNetAgents\biorxiv\regnetagents_preprint.docx` in Microsoft Word
2. Click **File** → **Save As**
3. Choose location: Same folder (`biorxiv`)
4. File name: `regnetagents_preprint.pdf`
5. Save as type: **PDF**
6. Click **Save**

**Alternative: If you don't have Word installed**

Use Word Online (free):
1. Go to https://www.office.com
2. Sign in with Microsoft account (or create free account)
3. Upload `regnetagents_preprint.docx`
4. Click **File** → **Download as PDF**

**Final check** - Open the PDF and verify:

#### Part 4: Manuscript Information

**Title** (copy from your PDF):
```
RegNetAgents: A Validated Multi-Agent AI Framework for Automated Gene Regulatory Network Analysis and Therapeutic Target Prioritization
```

**Running Title**:
```
Multi-Agent Gene Regulatory Network Analysis
```

**Abstract** (copy from the updated preprint draft):
```
Gene regulatory network analysis is essential for understanding disease mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, and prioritizing therapeutic targets. However, traditional workflows require hours of manual effort across multiple databases and tools, with sequential processing limiting scalability. We present RegNetAgents, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that streamlines gene regulatory analysis through intelligent workflow orchestration and conversational interfaces. The system integrates network modeling, perturbation simulation, pathway enrichment, and multi-domain interpretation (cancer, drug development, clinical relevance, systems biology) into a unified accessible platform. Leveraging pre-computed ARACNe networks from 500,000+ single cells across 10 cell types (GREmLN team), the framework enables rapid hypothesis generation and experimental prioritization. Four specialized domain agents execute in parallel using local language models to generate scientific insights, with rule-based fallback for reliability. Automated perturbation analysis simulates regulator inhibition and ranks candidate therapeutic targets using network centrality metrics (PageRank, degree centrality). To demonstrate framework capabilities, we analyzed a colorectal cancer biomarker panel (MYC, CTNNB1, CCND1, TP53, KRAS) with complete perturbation analysis (99 regulators) completing in 15-62 seconds depending on mode. Framework validation on colorectal cancer biomarkers showed 100% concordance with published literature across five genes, and perturbation analysis successfully identified experimentally validated TP53 regulators (WWTR1, YAP1 from Hippo pathway) alongside novel testable hypotheses. A conversational interface via Model Context Protocol enables natural language queries through Claude Desktop without programming expertise. RegNetAgents transforms multi-hour manual workflows into second-scale automated analysis, making sophisticated network analysis accessible to experimental biologists and providing a reusable framework for diverse biological questions.

2. Check the PDF preview
3. Read and accept terms and conditions
4. Click **"Submit"**

---

### Step 5: Confirmation

You'll receive:
1. **Immediate**: Confirmation email with submission ID
2. **Within 24-48 hours**: Email saying "under review" by bioRxiv screeners
3. **Within 1-3 days**: Email saying "posted" with your DOI and live link

**DOI format**: Will be something like `doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.20.xxxxxx`

---

## Phase 3: After Posting (~5 minutes)

### Step 1: Update Your Materials

Once you get your DOI and bioRxiv URL:

1. Update `one_page_summary.md`:
   - Line with `[DOI to be added]` → Add your actual DOI

2. Update `email_template.md`:
   - Line with `[bioRxiv URL - add after submission]` → Add your URL

### Step 2: Share (if you want)

**Minimal sharing** (our agreed plan):
- Send 3 emails using the template
- Wait 2 weeks
- Evaluate responses

**Optional sharing**:
- Add to your CV
- List on your lab website
- Mention in your email signature

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: PDF upload fails
**Solution**:
- Check file size (max 30 MB)
- Try re-saving as PDF with lower resolution images
- Split very long manuscripts into main + supplementary files

### Issue: "Manuscript doesn't meet criteria"
**Solution**:
- bioRxiv requires new research, not reviews/opinions
- Your work is new research, so this shouldn't happen
- If it does, email bioRxiv support: submit@biorxiv.org

### Issue: Figures aren't showing up
**Solution**:
- Embed figures directly in the PDF before uploading
- Or upload figures as supplementary files

### Issue: Can't find institution in dropdown
**Solution**:
- Type in the search box
- Or select "Other" and type manually

### Issue: Want to update preprint after posting
**Solution**:
- bioRxiv allows revisions
- Log in → "My Submissions" → Upload new version
- Both versions remain available (version tracking)
