# Email Template for Contacting Researchers

## How to Use This Template

1. **Pick 3 researchers** whose work you respect (see "How to Find Researchers" below)
2. **Customize the template** with their name and specific work
3. **Send 3 emails** (one per person)
4. **Wait 2 weeks** - no follow-up needed
5. **Evaluate responses** - if 2-3 respond positively, continue; if 0-1, stop here

### Subject Line Options:
- `Gene regulatory network analysis preprint`
- `Automated multi-agent framework for regulatory networks`
- `bioRxiv preprint on gene regulatory analysis`

### Email Body:

```
Dear Dr. [Last Name],

I recently posted a preprint on bioRxiv describing a multi-agent AI
framework for automated gene regulatory network analysis. Since you've
published work on [mention their specific work - e.g., "ARACNe networks"
or "colorectal cancer biomarkers" or "Hippo pathway regulation"], I
thought you might find it interesting.

The system automates labor-intensive manual workflows across
multiple databases (STRING, BioGRID, Enrichr, etc.) into subsecond analysis.
In a validation panel of five colorectal cancer biomarkers, framework
classifications showed 100% concordance with published literature, and the
perturbation analysis identified both known (CHD4, YAP1) and novel (RBPMS)
therapeutic targets for TP53.

Preprint: [bioRxiv URL - add after submission]

I've attached a one-page summary. No response needed—just wanted to share
in case it's relevant to your research.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title/Position]
[Your Institution]
[Your Email]
```

## How to Find 3 Researchers

### Option 1: From Your References
Look at the bioRxiv draft references:
- Authors of ARACNe papers (Margolin, Califano)
- Authors of colorectal cancer biomarker papers (citations 19-27)
- Authors of TP53 regulation papers (citations 29-34)
- Authors of YAP1/Hippo pathway papers (citations 32-34, 38-39)

### Option 2: Google Scholar Search
Search for:
- "gene regulatory networks single cell"
- "ARACNe algorithm"
- "colorectal cancer biomarkers"
- "TP53 regulation therapeutic targets"

Look for recent papers (2020-2025) and note the corresponding authors.

### Option 3: Who Would Benefit?
Think about who works on:
- Computational biology methods for scRNA-seq
- Cancer biomarker discovery
- Therapeutic target identification
- Systems biology and network analysis

### Suggested Targets:
1. **Someone who works on regulatory networks** (they'll understand the methods)
2. **Someone who does biomarker research** (they'll appreciate the application)
3. **Someone who does cancer biology** (they'll value the validation)

## Finding Email Addresses

### Where to Look:
1. **Paper websites**: Corresponding author email is usually in the paper
2. **University websites**: Search "[Name] [University]" → faculty page
3. **Google Scholar profile**: Sometimes lists institutional email
4. **Lab websites**: Most PIs have lab websites with contact info

## Customization Examples

### Example 1: ARACNe/Network Researcher
```
Since you developed the ARACNe algorithm that underpins our regulatory
networks, I thought you'd be interested in how we've integrated it into
a multi-agent framework for automated analysis.
```

### Example 2: Biomarker Researcher
```
Since you've published extensively on colorectal cancer biomarkers, I
thought you might find our automated biomarker classification approach
interesting—we validated it on MYC, CTNNB1, TP53, and KRAS with 100%
literature alignment.
```

### Example 3: TP53 Researcher
```
Since you've studied TP53 regulation, I thought you might be interested
in our perturbation analysis that identified CHD4 and YAP1 as top
therapeutic targets (both literature-validated) along with RBPMS as a
novel hypothesis.
```

### Example 4: Hippo Pathway Researcher
```
Since you work on YAP1 and Hippo signaling, I thought you'd find it
interesting that our automated perturbation analysis independently
identified YAP1 and WWTR1 as top regulators of TP53, validated by
pathway enrichment of Hippo signaling genes.

## What to Attach

**Attach**: `one_page_summary.pdf` (convert the markdown file to PDF)

**How to convert to PDF**:
1. Open `one_page_summary.md` in any markdown editor
2. Use Pandoc: `pandoc one_page_summary.md -o one_page_summary.pdf`
3. Or copy/paste into Google Docs and "Download as PDF"
4. Or use an online markdown-to-PDF converter

## Important Tips

### DO:
✅ Keep it short (5-6 sentences)
✅ Mention their specific work (shows you know what they do)
✅ Include the preprint link
✅ Say "No response needed" (reduces pressure)
✅ Attach one-page summary

### DON'T:
❌ Ask them to review your work
❌ Ask for a meeting/call (too much commitment)
❌ Send follow-up emails if they don't respond
❌ Send to more than 3 people initially (keep it targeted)
❌ Use generic "Dear Researcher" (personalize it)

## What Responses to Expect

### Good Signs (2-3 people respond):
- "Thanks for sharing, looks interesting!"
- "I'd like to discuss this further"
- "Could you send me the code?"
- "Would you be interested in collaborating?"

### Neutral (1 person responds):
- "Thanks" (short, polite acknowledgment)
- No response from others

### Stop Signs (0 responses):
- No one replies after 2 weeks
- → This means the work isn't resonating yet
- → Stop here, move on with your life

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Send 3 emails
- **Day 14**: Check responses
- **Decision**:
  - 2-3 positive responses → Continue (email 5 more people)
  - 0-1 responses → Stop here (no more effort)

## Sample Tracker

Keep track of who you email:

| Name | Institution | Email | Sent Date | Response? | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Dr. Smith | MIT | smith@mit.edu | 2025-01-20 | Yes (positive) | Wants to discuss |
| Dr. Jones | Stanford | jones@stanford.edu | 2025-01-20 | No | - |
| Dr. Lee | Harvard | lee@harvard.edu | 2025-01-20 | Yes (neutral) | "Thanks" only |

## Remember

**This is a low-pressure test.**
- You're just sharing your work with 3 people
- No follow-up needed
- If they don't respond, that's okay
- You can stop at any time

**Goal**: See if anyone finds your work interesting before investing more time.
