## ✅ AUTOMATED CHECKS COMPLETED

### 1. Placeholder Text Check ✅ PASS
- ✅ No [TODO], [FILL IN], [TBD], or similar placeholders found
- ✅ Author information complete: Jose A. Bird, PhD
- ✅ All figure and table references present
- ✅ Data availability statements included

### 2. Terminology Consistency Check ✅ MOSTLY GOOD

**Consistent usage found**:
- ✅ "RegNetAgents" (capitalization consistent throughout)

**Minor inconsistency noted**:
- ⚠️ Line 18: Abstract mentions "GREmLN team" but line 36 says "RegNetAgents (Gene Regulatory Embedding-based Large Neural model)"
  - **Check**: Are these the same project? Abstract says "GREmLN team" but paper says "RegNetAgents team"
  - **Resolution needed**: Clarify if GREmLN = RegNetAgents or separate teams

### 3. Data/Numbers Consistency Check ✅ PASS

**Cross-referenced claims**:
- ✅ "10 cell types" - verified in multiple locations (lines 40, 61, 204)
- ✅ "500,000+ single cells" - consistent (lines 18, 40)
- ✅ "99 regulators" - consistent across Table 2, Results section (lines 220, 233, 257, 327)
- ✅ "15.49 seconds" for 5-gene analysis - consistent (lines 220, 233, 327)
- ✅ "100% alignment" claim - validated with 5/5 genes (line 269)
- ✅ Performance numbers match between abstract and results section
- ✅ TP53 regulator counts: 7 regulators (consistent in lines 245, 254, 273, 287)

### 4. Citation Format Check ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION

**Issues found**:
- ⚠️ Line 63: Reference (17) appears before (18) - **Reactome is ref 17, but should be 18**
- ⚠️ Reference numbering: Reactome appears as ref (17) in line 63 but citation 18 in references list
- ⚠️ Check: Reference ordering should match first appearance in text

**Action needed**: Verify references 17-18 are in correct order

### 5. Sensitive Information Check ✅ PASS
- ✅ No internal file paths exposed
- ✅ No API keys or credentials
- ✅ No proprietary data mentioned
- ✅ Email address is professional: jbird@birdaisolutions.com

### 6. Figure/Table References Check ✅ PASS
- ✅ Figure 1 referenced (line 52)
- ✅ Figure 2 referenced (line 245)
- ✅ Figure 3 referenced (line 273)
- ⚠️ Figure 4 mentioned (line 304) but not in figure list - **CHECK IF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUPPLEMENTARY**
- ✅ Table 1 referenced (line 226)
- ✅ Table 2 referenced (line 245, 248)
- ✅ Table 3 referenced (line 273, 275)
- ⚠️ Table S1 mentioned (line 311) - supplementary, OK

### 7. Common Typos/Grammar Check ✅ MOSTLY GOOD

**Found**:

  - **Clarify**: Do domain agents run in parallel or sequentially?
  - **Found**: Line 53 says "parallel", line 160 says "sequential" - **INCONSISTENCY**

### 8. Abbreviation Consistency ✅ PASS
- ✅ GRN defined on first use (line 27)
- ✅ scRNA-seq defined (line 28)
- ✅ MCP defined (line 32)
- ✅ ARACNe defined (line 36)
- ✅ FDR defined (line 64)
- ✅ CRC defined (line 240)
- ✅ EMT defined (line 297)

## ⚠️ ISSUES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Submission):

**1. GREmLN vs RegNetAgents Team Confusion** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Location**: Abstract line 18 vs Introduction line 36
- **Issue**: Abstract says "GREmLN team" but later text says "RegNetAgents team"
- **Question**: Are these the same project/team?
- **Action**: Check the Zhang et al. 2025 paper - is it called GREmLN or RegNetAgents?
- **Suggested fix**: Pick one name and use consistently, or clarify "RegNetAgents (formerly GREmLN)"

**2. Figure 4 Reference Missing** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Location**: Line 304
- **Issue**: Text mentions "Figure 4" but only 3 figures are in figure legends
- **Options**:
  - (A) Create Figure 4 for cross-cell comparison
  - (B) Change to "data not shown"
  - (C) Change to "Table X" if you have tabular data
  - (D) Remove figure reference and just describe results

**3. Parallel vs Sequential Domain Agents** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Location**: Line 53 vs Line 160
- **Issue**: Line 53 says "execute in parallel", Line 160 says "sequential"
- **Question**: Do the 4 domain agents run simultaneously or one after another?
- **Action**: Check your code implementation and make text consistent

**4. Reference Numbering** ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY
- **Location**: Line 63 (Reactome cited as 17)
- **Issue**: Might be out of order
- **Action**: Verify reference 17 and 18 are correct in your references list

```
OPTION A: Remove the reference
- Change line 304: "(Figure 4)" → "(data not shown)" or just remove
